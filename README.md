# Basics-of-clustering

Hey all!! This repository contains `.py` (Python) and `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebok) files for four popular clustering algorithms. These four clustering algorithms are 

* **k-means clustering**
* **Fuzzy c-means clustering**
* **Hierarchical Clustering**
* **DBSCAN**

Also to run the code, dataset is also provided in **`Data_set`** folder. It contains three unlabelled dataset and one labelled dataset. For better understanding, I suggest to run `.ipynb` files in **[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)**. 

## Prerequisities
* **[Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads)**
* **[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)**
* **[matplotlib 2.0+](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)**
* **[numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)**
