# Basics-of-clustering

Hey all!! This repository contains `.py` (Python) and `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebok) files for four popular clustering algorithms. These four clustering algorithms are 

* **k-means clustering**
* **Fuzzy c-means clustering**
* **Hierarchical Clustering**
* **DBSCAN**

Also to run the code, dataset is also provided in **`Data_set`** folder. It contains three unlabelled dataset and one labelled dataset. For better understanding, I prefer to run `.ipynb` files in **Jupyter Notebook**.
